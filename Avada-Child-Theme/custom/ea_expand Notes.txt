Notes on the ea_expand project 

Files to the functioning of this add-on.
-------------------
 - php [ea_expand_image.php]
 - js  [ea_expand_image.js]
 - css [ea_expand_image.scss & .css]
 - this text file.

Parts of the functioning
----------------------
1. [php] add a check box in the media libary when you add a image into an article to opt out of the expanding. (using post_meta _eaNoExpand for image)
2. [php] if the Expandable check box is checked, dont a class (ea-expandable) to the image as it is inserted into an article
3. [php] If a caption is used, add a class (ea-contracted-image) to the the caption that we can toggle on & off.
4.  [js] A js script checks for ea-expandable class of an image.  & toggles the classes of the parent from ea-contracted-image & ea-expanded-image. 
5.  [css] css targets an image with the ea-expandable & the wp-caption container of ea-expanded-image or ex-contracted-image.

Caveats. (aka zig's worries)
-------
1.  adding the ea-contracted-image class to the caption via the img_caption_shortcode filter (which isnt really a filter, but more of a override).  if something else wants hooks onto that filter, this may not work.
